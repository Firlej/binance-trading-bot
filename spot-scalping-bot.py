# Simple implementation of a trading bot using a scalping strategy. Periodically  ##
# buys a product using a market buy for the minimum amount allowed by the         ##
# exchange on the selected market pair and immidietaly places a limit sell order  ##
# for a slightly higher price.                                                    ##
